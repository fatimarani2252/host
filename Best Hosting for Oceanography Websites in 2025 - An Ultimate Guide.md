### Scalability:
As your oceanography website grows, you'll need a hosting solution that can scale with your needs. Scala Hosting's VPS plans offer excellent scalability, allowing you to easily increase resources like CPU, RAM, and storage as needed. This ensures that your website can handle increasing traffic and data without performance issues. The scalability also allows you to adjust resources based on specific project requirements, providing cost-effectiveness in the long run.
