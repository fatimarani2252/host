Their SShield security system actively monitors your server for threats and automatically blocks malicious traffic.

### Scalability
As your network admin website grows, Scala Hosting offers seamless scalability. You can easily upgrade your VPS resources (CPU, RAM, storage) with just a few clicks, ensuring your website continues to perform optimally as your traffic increases. This avoids any performance bottlenecks and keeps your website running smoothly.

### Customer Support
